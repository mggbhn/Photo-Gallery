      <h1> "A Collection of Blue Murals" </h1>

      <p> Below is a collection of blue murals throughout the world. The color blue
      is often represented as a symbol of knowledge, calmness, and tranquility.
      It can also be a symbol of infiniteness, as it is commonly associated with
      the sky and ocean. Murals have been integrated in society as long as humans
      have been alive. Murals help showcase diversity of different cultures over
      time, and assist represent peoples lives through art. We hope you enjoy.
